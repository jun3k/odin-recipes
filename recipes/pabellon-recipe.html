            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    The Pabellón Criollo is basically a dish that consists of flavorful shredded beef, rice and black beans that had been stewed. As simple as it may seem to be, many consider it to be Venezuela's national dish. Variations of the dish exist but the preparation remains the same.

                    It could be served with tajadas or fried plantains on the side, to add flavor as well as prevent the food from slipping to the sides of the plate. In this case the classic dish is called pabellón con baranda, in which “baranda” translates to guard rail.
