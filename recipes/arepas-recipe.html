            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>A South American staple, particularly in Columbia and Venezuela, arepas are stuffed cornmeal cakes that are crispy outside and fluffy inside. They're a popular food item for street vendors, but are also regularly made in homes. Arepas are eaten at all times of the day, often as a snack or side dish to a main meal.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 ½ cups lukewarm water</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>2 cups pre-cooked whit cornmeal (such as P.A.N.)</li>
                    <li>¼ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>How to make</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Stir water and salt together in a medium bowl; gradually stir in cornmeal with your fingers until the mixture forms a soft, moist, malleable dough.</li>
                    <li>Form dough into eight 2-inch diameter balls; pat each ball to flatten into a 3/8-inch-thick arepa patty.</li>
                    <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry arepas in batches until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer cooked arepas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain until cool enough to handle.</li>
                    <li>Slice halfway through each arepa horizontally with a thin serrated knife to form a pita-like pocket.
                    </li>
                </ol>
